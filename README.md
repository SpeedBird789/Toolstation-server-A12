# About this project

In this project, I tried to make a Tools manufacturer website. Due to time constraint, couldn't add a few more features and functionalities which I hope will implement once I sit with it again. To summarise:

* One can place order clicking on the place order button from the tools displayed.
* Shows the business summary (12k Customer, 3k tools etc) of the manufacturer.
* Testimonials where there are reviews given by its customers.
* Blogs answers some of the basic questions (just for mu practice)
* One can subscribe to their newsletter by providing their email addres.
