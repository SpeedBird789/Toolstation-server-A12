## Overview

ToolStation is a full-stack website built to simulate a tools manufacturing company. This involved building a backend, handling data in MongoDB, and creating a user interface with ReactJS. The site allows users to place orders for tools, explore customer reviews, and more.

## Features

- **Order Placement**: Users can browse through available tools and place an order by clicking on the 'Place Order' button. This can then be managed in the Dashboard section (only accessible after logging in and placing an order) ![Dashboard Section](https://i.ibb.co/85qb9yZ/Dashboard-TS.png)
